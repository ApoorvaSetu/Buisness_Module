## Why is Netflix not working well in India, but Amazon prime video is?

### Backstory and Problem:

Speaking during an investor call Reed Hastings, the cofounder of Netflix said, "In every other major market, we've got the flywheel spinning.

the Indians watch, have a lot of content in regional languages.

Amazon prime video, being an American company, is doing better than Netflix.
