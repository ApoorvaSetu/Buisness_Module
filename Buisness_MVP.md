### Validating my hpothesis:

1. Netflix has higher subscription fee:

 The monthly subscription fee offered by Netflix is higher than Amazon Prime.
 
2. Number of regional language content on Amazon Prime is more than that on Netflix. Netflix focuses more on English and Hindi content.

Clearly, Amazon Prime has many movies and series in the regional languages like Telugu, Tamil, Kannada etc.

3. What are the piracy policies of both the companies?

Netflix tends to be pirated for the longest period — 26 months, compared with 16 months for Amazon Prime Video. 
That could be because Netflix freeloaders often mooch off their family instead of a friend — 48 percent use their parents’ login, 
while another 14 percent use their sister or brother’s credentials. 
Having said that, Piracy exists in all the countries and does not show any strong correlation specific to India.

4. Does Amazon prime have better Features?

When it comes to add-on features, Amazon Prime knocks it out of the park. It surpasses Netflix in this area because it does what Amazon does best — 
it functions as a marketplace. The service offers several add-on channels you can purchase to further customize your experience, like Showtime.

## Further work: 

- Check for the library size for both Netflix and Amzon prime.
- Check for exact count of regional conten on both the platforms.
- Think about solutions for Netflix to become the top OTT platform in India.
