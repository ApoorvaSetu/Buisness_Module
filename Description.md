# Netflix and its Battle in India

## Abstract:

The goal of this project is to help Netflix with some insights to conquer the Indian market. 
In 2020, Reed Hastings, Co-founder of Netflix said, they are doing really doing well in major market, but have been frustrated that they are not able to capture the Indian market.
Once Netflix figured out the reason, they revised their subscription plan, which did draw few subscribers. But, they are still not the most popular. The most popular OTT platform as of May 2021 is Amazon Prime Video, which is also an American OTT Platform. What is it that MAzon Prime is doing and Netflix is not?
## My Hypothesis were:
### Regional content count - Amazon Prime has more regional content that Netflix.
### Subscrition fee - Amazon Prime offers monthly and yearly price across all the devices, whwereas Netflix offers monthly prices for various quality and devices.
### Value to customers - Amazon prime gives more reason for Indians to subscribe by providing add on features like free shipping, Free Kindle books etc. Netflix doesnot.
